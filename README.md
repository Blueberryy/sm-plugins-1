# Plugins for NGS's Source Games [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/NGSNetwork/sm-plugins.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/NGSNetwork/sm-plugins)
These are plugins for Source games (mainly TF2) that allow one to manipulate their server in various exciting ways. From a plugin to spawn bosses to an interface for "true democracy", you'll be able to shape your in-game world how you want, all courtesy of the [NGS servers series](https://www.neogenesisnetwork.net/). Our dedication to 95%+ FOSS has committed us to providing people the opportunity to learn from, modify, and release our vast variety of plugins. All of these plugins are free for anyone to do (almost) anything anywhere for any reason with under the [Unlicense license](https://github.com/NGSNetwork/sm-plugins/blob/master/LICENSE).

This repository is updated as often as updates are made to our plugins, and changes to our server series are at most only 1 hour ahead of this repository. We made this repo with the intention that our servers be easily duplicated by anyone with the same quality we expect from ourselves. From us, you can expect:
* Changes within a day of them going live on our servers.
* Code compliance for 2+ versions of Sourcemod ahead.
* Automatic updates to most installed plugins through the [Updater Plugin](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=169095).
* Well-documented developer interfaces for plugins we release or modify.
* Thorough documentation at the top of each plugins source file explaining important developer and client metadata.

*If you find that we are not expressing compliance of our own standards with a recently modified plugin, please open an issue and point us in the right direction.*

## Contributing
We appreciate all contributions and welcome them as adults! If you would like to contribute, open a pull request ensuring that you are following all the guarantees we ourselves have listed above, and that you are open to both suggestions and suggesting. Also please be able to explain your code, e.g. why a particular change was made.

## Feedback
We view proper feedback as a requirement of any software that influences a user's experience. Feel free to open a new issue to request a new feature, ask a question, or file a bug!

Disclaimer: Sometimes we modify others' plugins! If any such plugins were released with their own license, [LICENSE](https://github.com/NGSNetwork/sm-plugins/blob/master/LICENSE) does not overwrite it. Use theirs instead, for all cases.
